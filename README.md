# pedometer

My attempt on simple offline python pedometer.
Tried to fit in as few lines as possible without making the code too obscure.
Data are to be recorded with Physics Toolbox Android app.

For actual working it needs to get it's parameters adjusted for specific case.

There are also to sample datasets.
